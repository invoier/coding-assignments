# Invoier Frontend assignment 

Hi!
First of all; thank you for taking the time to do our technical test! Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the main requirements have been met. We understand people have busy lives and would guide you to spend no more than 4-5 hours on a submission.

## Assignment:

Create an app, or a view that holds information on Offers to purchase an Invoice. An offer is consisting of a Price, a range of "Invoice Amount", i.e min and max Invoice Amount and "Days left until Due Date" and for this case an Invoice is an object consisting of 4 elements - Invoiced Amount, Merchant, Customer, Due Date and Date. 

The view should contain offers matching the Invoice values. look at example below, The offers should be sortable based on Price and should only be shown if the Invoice matches the Offer criteria.

How you chose to represent this, as a list view, card view or however is totally up to you. Spend time on the things that interest you! Feel free to mock the data inside your app, but be ready to answer questions on how you would implement a full API solution towards the backend server.

Make sure to show your creativity in your solution, how would you design this and how would you want it to look.

## Requirements:

Even though the Orders can be hardcoded, please implement so that we could swap the hardcoded solution to a dynamic API call towards the backend, and be ready to answer questions on next steps.

Languages: Typescript, JavaScript

Frameworks: React is a preferred base, but feel free to include others, but be ready to answer questions on the libraries you pull in.

## Guidelines

Keep it simple!
Use 3rd party libraries with moderation and try to find the right balance
If there are priorities to be made, we prefer you implementing a smaller set of features
using your own code, rather than use a large framework

## Bonus task(s)

If you feel like it, also solve one or more of these bonus tasks. This is not strictly required but will
naturally be taken into consideration and cater for more interesting discussions during the tech
interview.

**Persistence** - storing the state of the sorted component

**Hosting** - Host the browser in a place where others can access it.

## Submission

We really like to hear about the things that didnâ€™t go so well also, please feel free to give us feedback and discuss what went wrong.

Please share the link to the github repository where you committed the code or zip the code and distribute it to us.
